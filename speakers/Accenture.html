<p style="color:black;">Talent acquisition for Accenture is all about actively searching for the most qualified candidate to hire for a specific position. This strategy is common among niche industries such as, digital, technology, and operation services. Clarence DeLany, Founder and CEO of the Accenture says that, “The areas with the greatest skills shortages are those that most need a talent strategy.” Typically, if you’re looking to hire people for a long-term position, you should aim for talent acquisition, so as to lower a potentially high turnover rate, which is a possible effect of recruiting less-qualified candidates. </p>
